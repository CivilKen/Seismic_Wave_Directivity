# Seismic_Wave_Directivity
Based on previous research, ground motion can be amplified in certain direction and show with significant anisotropy. The causes still remain unclear, and different researchers have attributed this phenomenon to several factors, including topographic effect, local geological heterogeneities, wave polarization, wave trapped in fault zone and etc. This phenomenon might have severe impacts on buildings that cause damages, especially in the near-fault area. However, the current seismic design code focus on the perpendicular direction of fault strike only, which is not suitable enough for real situation. The objective of this study will focus on seismic wave directivity in near-fault zone. A total of 104 earthquake events with basic geological data were collected. Causative factors were selected based on previous research. There are three main causes considered of free field stations, included wave polarization, anisotropic stiffness and forward directivity. Data of influence factors were collected accordingly, and Arias Intensity is used to describe the directivity of seismic wave. The deep learning technique was applied to predict Arias Intensity distribution with the given parameters. This research used TensorFlow as the main deep learning tool.
